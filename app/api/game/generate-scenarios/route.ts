**Player Context:**
- Skill Level: ${skillLevel}
- Age Bracket: ${ageBracket}

**Cheat Code Details:**
- Title: ${cheat_code_data.title}
- Category: ${cheat_code_data.category}
- What: ${cheat_code_data.what || 'N/A'}
- When: ${cheat_code_data.when || 'N/A'}
- How: ${cheat_code_data.how || 'N/A'}
- Why: ${cheat_code_data.why || 'N/A'}
- Phrase: ${cheat_code_data.phrase || 'N/A'}
- Original Situation: ${cheat_code_data.original_situation || 'N/A'}
- Original Thought: ${cheat_code_data.original_thought || 'N/A'}

Generate exactly ${scenarioCount} practice scenarios that are DIRECTLY RELATED to this specific cheat code and the mental block it addresses.

🚨 🚨 🚨 CRITICAL - SCENARIO RELEVANCE (MOST IMPORTANT RULE):
Every single scenario MUST be about the EXACT situation this cheat code addresses. Do NOT create scenarios about unrelated basketball situations.

**Examples of what TO DO:**
- If the cheat code is about "trusting your shot" → ALL scenarios must be about shooting situations (open looks, taking shots, shot selection)
- If the cheat code is about "driving to the basket" → ALL scenarios must be about attacking the rim, finishing at the hoop
- If the cheat code is about "staying aggressive after mistakes" → ALL scenarios must be about recovering from errors and staying confident
- If the cheat code is about "not comparing to teammates" → ALL scenarios must be about comparison situations, stats, playing time

**Examples of what NOT TO DO:**
- ❌ Code about "trusting your shot" → Scenario about getting benched (WRONG - not about shooting)
- ❌ Code about "trusting your shot" → Scenario about technical fouls (WRONG - not about shooting)
- ❌ Code about "driving confidence" → Scenario about missing free throws (WRONG - not about driving)
- ❌ Code about "post-game reflection" → Scenario about pre-game nerves (WRONG - different timing)

Read the "When", "What", "Original Situation" fields carefully to understand the EXACT context where this code should be used, and create scenarios that match that EXACT context.

🚨 CRITICAL - CONTEXTUAL APPROPRIATENESS:
You MUST tailor scenarios AND answer options to match the player's level and age. Use the player context above to determine appropriate scenarios and answers.

🚨 CRITICAL - AGE-APPROPRIATE ANSWER OPTIONS:
- **Youth players ONLY (age 13-17, NOT high school/college)**: Can use phrases like "I'm learning", "I'm still developing", "I'm working on it"
- **High school players**: NEVER use "I'm learning" language. Use performance-focused language like:
  - ✅ "Execute my training" (not "I'm learning")
  - ✅ "Trust my preparation" (not "I'm still developing")
  - ✅ "Attack the moment" (not "I'm trying my best")
  - ✅ "Next play" (not "I'll get better")
- **College players**: NEVER use "I'm learning" language. Use competitive, performance-based language like:
  - ✅ "Focus on execution" (not "I'm learning")
  - ✅ "Trust my skills" (not "I'm still developing")
  - ✅ "Attack the opportunity" (not "I'm trying my best")
- **Adult players (18+, recreational, men's league)**: NEVER use youth phrases. Use mature, experience-based language like:
  - ✅ "Focus on execution" (not "I'm learning")
  - ✅ "Trust my training" (not "I'm still developing")
  - ✅ "Attack the opportunity" (not "I'm trying my best")
  - ✅ "Next play" (not "I'll get better")
- **Pro players**: Use elite performance language without any developmental framing

🚨 CRITICAL - LANGUAGE TONE (MUST FOLLOW):
Use supportive, encouraging language that builds confidence. AVOID harsh or extreme scenarios:
- ❌ NEVER use "laugh/laughing at you" → ✅ USE "react/notice/respond"
- ❌ NEVER use "way better than you" → ✅ USE "more experienced/higher level"
- ❌ AVOID extreme embarrassment language → ✅ USE gentler alternatives like "noticed/focused on"
- ❌ NEVER scenarios about coaches laughing → ✅ USE constructive coaching moments
- Keep situations realistic but not harsh or demoralizing
- Frame challenges as opportunities for growth, not sources of shame
- Use language that acknowledges difficulty without being overwhelming

🚨 CRITICAL: Create TWO TYPES of scenarios in a RANDOM MIX:

**TYPE 1: INTERNAL REFRAME (60% of scenarios)**
- Tests what the player should think IN THE MOMENT during performance
- Focuses on mental shifts during play (what to focus on, how to approach the situation)
- Example situations: At free throw line, driving to hoop, open shot opportunity, defensive play
- Optimal answer should align with the cheat code's mental shift phrase

**TYPE 2: EXTERNAL BELIEF (40% of scenarios)**
- Tests the player's understanding of what OTHERS are actually thinking about them
- Challenges false beliefs about judgment, expectations, letting others down
- 🚨 CRITICAL: These MUST be about the EXACT SAME situation as the cheat code, just testing beliefs about others' reactions

**How to create external belief scenarios:**
1. Take the EXACT situation from the cheat code (e.g., "taking a shot when open")
2. Add a layer of worrying about what others think in THAT EXACT situation
3. DO NOT change the situation to something different

**Examples:**
- ✅ Code about "trusting your shot" → External scenario: "You're open for a shot but hesitate because you think teammates will judge you if you miss" (CORRECT - same situation, adds external worry)
- ❌ Code about "trusting your shot" → External scenario: "Coach benches you after a bad performance" (WRONG - completely different situation)
- ✅ Code about "driving confidence" → External scenario: "You have a lane to attack but worry the defender will think you're reckless" (CORRECT - same situation, adds external worry)
- ❌ Code about "driving confidence" → External scenario: "You miss a free throw and teammates react" (WRONG - free throws aren't drives)

**The formula:**
[Cheat code situation] + [worry about others' judgment in THAT situation] = External belief scenario

NEVER create scenarios about getting benched, technical fouls, or other situations UNLESS the cheat code itself is specifically about those situations.

🚨 MATCH SCENARIOS TO PLAYER LEVEL:
- **High school/college/pro players**: Can include scouts, college coaches, recruitment pressure, film room analysis
- **Recreational/adult league players**: Focus on teammates, friends watching, personal expectations, proving yourself in pickup games, league game pressure
- **Youth players (13-17)**: Focus on parents watching, coach expectations, making the team, peer pressure, school team dynamics
- NEVER mention scouts, recruitment, or professional contexts for recreational or youth players
- NEVER use youth-specific scenarios (parents in stands, making the team) for adult recreational players
- Optimal answer should challenge the FALSE belief about what others think IN THIS SPECIFIC CONTEXT
- Should show that external pressure related to THEIR issue is self-created or misunderstood

Each scenario format:
{
  "situation": "Brief basketball scenario (1-2 sentences)",
  "current_thought": "The negative thought",
  "scenario_type": "internal" | "external",
  "options": [
    {
      "text": "Answer option text",
      "type": "negative" | "helpful" | "optimal",
      "feedback": "Explanation of why this answer is negative/helpful/optimal (2-3 sentences)"
    }
  ]
}

🚨 CRITICAL - FEEDBACK REQUIREMENTS:
- **For "negative" answers**: Explain why this thought keeps them stuck or makes performance worse
- **For "helpful" answers**: MUST explain (1) why this is better than negative BUT (2) why it's still not optimal. Be encouraging but clear about what's missing.
  - Example: "This thought is more positive, which helps. But it's still focused on avoiding mistakes rather than attacking the opportunity. The optimal reframe shifts you into action mode."
- **For "optimal" answers**: Explain why this thought creates the best mental state for performance

🚨 REQUIREMENTS:
- Mix internal and external scenarios randomly (don't group them)
- For EXTERNAL scenarios: Use huge variety of contexts but ALL must relate to THIS player's specific issue
  * If they struggle with missing shots → external scenarios about missing shots and others' reactions
  * If they struggle with comparison → external scenarios about comparing to others and false beliefs about worth
  * If they struggle with pressure → external scenarios about judgment in high-pressure moments
- NEVER create generic external scenarios unrelated to their core issue
- Each external scenario should feel like a different angle/context of the SAME underlying fear/belief
- Always provide 4 options: 2 negative, 1 helpful, 1 optimal
- Randomize the order of the 4 options in each scenario
- **CRITICAL**: ALL 4 answer options MUST be age-appropriate per the guidelines above
  * For adult recreational/men's league players: NO "I'm learning" or developmental language in ANY options
  * Use experience-based, action-focused language appropriate for their age and level
- Optimal answers for internal = mental shift phrase alignment
- Optimal answers for external = challenging false belief about others' perceptions IN THEIR SPECIFIC CONTEXT

🚨 EXAMPLES:

**RECREATIONAL/ADULT PLAYER - "fear of missing clutch free throws and letting team down":**
- INTERNAL scenario: At free throw line in close game → shift to "attack it"
- EXTERNAL scenario 1: Miss a free throw, see teammate's reaction → challenge belief they're judging you
- EXTERNAL scenario 2: Friends watching from sideline in league game → challenge belief they think you're not good
- EXTERNAL scenario 3: Playing pickup and missing shots → challenge belief others won't pass to you anymore

**HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER - "fear of missing clutch free throws and letting team down":**
- INTERNAL scenario: At free throw line in close game → shift to "attack it"
- EXTERNAL scenario 1: Miss free throw with scout watching → challenge belief one miss ruins your chances
- EXTERNAL scenario 2: Coach talks to you after missed free throws → challenge belief coach is giving up on you
- EXTERNAL scenario 3: Parents watching in crucial game → challenge belief they'll be disappointed

ALL scenarios connect to the same core issue but are contextually appropriate to the player's level.
