# Onboarding Cheat Codes - Draft Options (EXPANDED)

## 1. Airball in front of everyone / Someone laughs

### **Option A: "Bounce Back Protocol"**
- **Phrase:** "Next play mentality"
- **What:** This helps you recover instantly from embarrassing mistakes and get your head back in the game without dwelling on what just happened.
- **When:** Use this the moment after any mistake that makes you feel exposed or embarrassed - whether it's an airball, turnover, or any play that makes you want to hide.
- **How:**
  1. Take one deep breath and physically shake out your shoulders
  2. Say "next play" out loud or in your head
  3. Immediately look for your next defensive assignment or offensive opportunity
- **Why:** Your brain wants to protect you from embarrassment by making you hyper-focus on the mistake. But dwelling on it actually makes you play worse. By forcing your attention to the next play, you break that mental loop and give yourself permission to move forward. The physical reset (breath + shoulder shake) interrupts the stress response in your body.
- **Vibe:** Action-oriented, forward-focused, "no time to dwell"

### **Option B: "Short Memory System"**
- **Phrase:** "Already forgot it"
- **What:** This is a deliberate mental technique to erase bad plays from your mind so they don't compound and ruin your confidence for the rest of the game.
- **When:** Use this when you catch yourself replaying a mistake in your head, or when you feel that sinking feeling after a bad play.
- **How:**
  1. Acknowledge the mistake happened (don't deny it)
  2. Tell yourself "already forgot it" with conviction
  3. Visualize the scoreboard or clock - remind yourself how much game is left
- **Why:** Elite players have notoriously short memories for mistakes. They can compartmentalize bad plays without letting them affect future decisions. This technique trains your brain to literally forget mistakes on command, preventing the "snowball effect" where one mistake leads to three more because you're in your head.
- **Vibe:** Cool, unbothered, "that didn't even happen"

### **Option C: "Lock Back In"**
- **Phrase:** "That's done, I'm here now"
- **What:** This helps you close the chapter on a bad play and fully return to the present moment where your actual performance happens.
- **When:** Use this when you feel stuck replaying what just happened, or when you notice your mind is anywhere except the current play.
- **How:**
  1. Name the emotion you're feeling ("I feel embarrassed, that's normal")
  2. Say your phrase: "That's done, I'm here now"
  3. Focus on one physical sensation - feel your feet on the floor, the ball in your hands, etc.
- **Why:** Embarrassment lives in the past. Performance lives in the present. When you ground yourself in physical sensations (mindfulness technique), you literally can't be dwelling on the past because your brain is occupied with present-moment awareness. This is the same technique Olympic athletes use.
- **Vibe:** Mature, centered, mindful, "I'm bigger than one play"

## 2. Coach yells at you / Can't shake it off

### **Option A: "Reset & Refocus"**
- **Phrase:** "Heard it, moving forward"
- **What:** This helps you process tough coaching without letting it destroy your confidence or make you play timid for the rest of practice/game.
- **When:** Use this right after getting yelled at by a coach, parent, or teammate - when you feel that stinging feeling and want to either shut down or get defensive.
- **How:**
  1. Take a breath and nod (shows you heard them, even if it hurt)
  2. Tell yourself "Heard it, moving forward"
  3. Make your next play aggressive, not timid - show them you're still confident
- **Why:** When authority figures criticize us harshly, our brain interprets it as a threat and we either fight (get defensive) or flight (play scared). This code acknowledges the feedback without internalizing it as "I'm not good enough." It separates the message from the delivery method, so you can learn without losing confidence.
- **Vibe:** Resilient, respectful but unbothered, "I can take coaching"

### **Option B: "Filter System"**
- **Phrase:** "Take what helps, leave the rest"
- **What:** This is a mental filtering technique to extract useful coaching from harsh delivery, so you get better without getting beaten down emotionally.
- **When:** Use this when coach's words are mixing valid points with emotional intensity, and you need to sort through what's actually helpful.
- **How:**
  1. Ask yourself "What's the actual instruction here?" (ignore the tone)
  2. Say "Take what helps, leave the rest"
  3. Apply the useful feedback, forget the emotional charge
- **Why:** Not all coaches communicate perfectly. Some are intense, some yell, some say things they don't mean when frustrated. If you absorb everything emotionally, you'll be destroyed. If you reject everything defensively, you won't improve. This teaches you to be a smart filter - take the gold, leave the garbage.
- **Vibe:** Smart, mature, "I don't take everything personally"

### **Option C: "Process & Play"**
- **Phrase:** "Got the message, back to work"
- **What:** This helps you quickly process criticism and get back to performing at your best instead of staying in your head about what was said.
- **When:** Use this when you find yourself replaying what coach said, questioning if you're good enough, or playing tentative because you're worried about getting yelled at again.
- **How:**
  1. Identify the one thing they want you to fix
  2. Say "Got the message, back to work"
  3. Execute that one thing on the next play, then move on
- **Why:** The goal of coaching is improved performance, not emotional damage. But when we ruminate on harsh words, we actually perform worse because we're scared and overthinking. This code keeps you coachable (you heard them) while keeping you confident (you're not dwelling on it).
- **Vibe:** Professional, focused, "I'm here to get better, not get emotional"

## 3. Playing great, miss one shot and spiral

### **Option A: "One Shot Rule"**
- **Phrase:** "One miss doesn't change the game"
- **What:** This protects your hot streak and prevents one miss from killing the confidence that was working for you.
- **When:** Use this the moment you miss after making several shots in a row - when you feel that first hint of doubt creeping in.
- **How:**
  1. Remind yourself how many you just made before this one
  2. Say "One miss doesn't change the game"
  3. Keep the same aggressive mindset on your next shot
- **Why:** When you're hot, your brain is in an optimal confidence state. One miss can trigger catastrophic thinking ("I'm cold now," "I lost it"). This code zooms out to the bigger picture - you're still the same player who just made 5 in a row. One data point doesn't erase the trend. It's statistics, not magic.
- **Vibe:** Rational, confident, "I know who I am"

### **Option B: "Keep Shooting"**
- **Phrase:** "Shooters shoot"
- **What:** This reinforces your identity as a scorer and keeps you aggressive after a miss, preventing the tentative mindset that ruins hot streaks.
- **When:** Use this when you miss and feel the urge to pass up your next shot because you're worried about going cold.
- **How:**
  1. Acknowledge the miss but don't analyze it
  2. Say "Shooters shoot" with conviction
  3. Look for your next shot opportunity immediately
- **Why:** Great scorers have short memories and strong identities. They define themselves as "shooters" - people who shoot even when they miss. When you start second-guessing yourself after one miss, you stop being aggressive, which actually makes you cold. This code keeps your identity intact so your play style doesn't change.
- **Vibe:** Aggressive, confident, "that's who I am"

### **Option C: "Protect the Rhythm"**
- **Phrase:** "Still in my zone"
- **What:** This helps you maintain the flow state you were in, treating the miss as a blip that doesn't kick you out of your rhythm.
- **When:** Use this when you feel the flow state starting to slip after a miss - when your mind wants to start analyzing instead of just playing.
- **How:**
  1. Feel your body - notice you're still loose, still moving well
  2. Say "Still in my zone"
  3. Return to the physical feel that was working (your shot rhythm, your footwork)
- **Why:** Flow state is fragile - it can be disrupted by self-consciousness or overthinking. When you miss, your brain wants to shift into analytical mode to "fix" it. But that kills the flow. This code keeps you in body-mode instead of brain-mode, maintaining the effortless feeling that made you hot in the first place.
- **Vibe:** Smooth, unbothered, "I'm still flowing"

## 4. Teammates counting on you / Feel the pressure

### **Option A: "Pressure Privilege"**
- **Phrase:** "This is what I've trained for"
- **What:** This helps you reframe high-pressure moments as opportunities instead of threats, so you perform better when it matters most.
- **When:** Use this when stakes are high - late in a close game, teammates looking to you, everyone watching - and you feel that weight on your shoulders.
- **How:**
  1. Notice the pressure but don't fight it
  2. Say "This is what I've trained for"
  3. Remember a time in practice when you executed this same play
- **Why:** Pressure is just your body getting ready to perform. The physical feeling (elevated heart rate, heightened focus) is the same whether you're excited or anxious - the difference is how you interpret it. When you view pressure as a privilege (they trust you) and reminder of your preparation (you've done this 1000 times), your nervous system works FOR you instead of against you.
- **Vibe:** Ready, grateful, "bring it on"

### **Option B: "Trust Your Work"**
- **Phrase:** "I'm ready for this"
- **What:** This anchors your confidence to your preparation, not the moment, so pressure can't shake you because you know you've put in the work.
- **When:** Use this when pressure is making you doubt yourself, or when the moment feels too big and you're questioning if you belong.
- **How:**
  1. Take a breath and think of one recent practice session
  2. Say "I'm ready for this"
  3. Execute like it's just another rep
- **Why:** Confidence under pressure comes from trusting your preparation. When you anchor to the work you've done (the reps, the practices, the hours), pressure becomes irrelevant because you know you're ready. The moment doesn't determine if you're good enough - the work already proved that.
- **Vibe:** Calm, prepared, "I've been here before in practice"

### **Option C: "Team Trust Protocol"**
- **Phrase:** "They believe in me, I believe in me"
- **What:** This uses your teammates' trust as fuel, turning their belief into your confidence when pressure is making you second-guess yourself.
- **When:** Use this when pressure is coming from trying not to let your team down, or when you feel like you don't want to disappoint people counting on you.
- **How:**
  1. Look at a teammate or remember them calling your name
  2. Say "They believe in me, I believe in me"
  3. Play for them, not for yourself
- **Why:** Sometimes our confidence wavers but our teammates' belief doesn't. When you tap into their trust, you borrow their perspective on you (capable, reliable, ready). This shifts focus from "what if I fail" to "they know I can do this." Social proof is powerful - if they believe it, you can too.
- **Vibe:** Supported, trusted, "I've got my team"

## 5. Matched up against someone way better

### **Option A: "Rise Up Challenge"**
- **Phrase:** "This is how I get better"
- **What:** This helps you see tough matchups as opportunities to improve instead of situations to survive, so you play with confidence even when you're the underdog.
- **When:** Use this when you're matched up against someone clearly better - whether it's their reputation, their size, their skill - and you feel intimidated.
- **How:**
  1. Acknowledge they're good, then acknowledge you're about to learn
  2. Say "This is how I get better"
  3. Attack them with your best moves - make them work
- **Why:** You only get better by playing up. When you're the underdog and you shift from "don't embarrass myself" to "let's see what I can learn," you remove the pressure and free yourself to actually compete. Growth mindset transforms threat into opportunity. Every possession against elite competition is practice for your future self.
- **Vibe:** Hungry, curious, "level up time"

### **Option B: "Prove It Mode"**
- **Phrase:** "Let's see what I've got"
- **What:** This reframes the matchup as a test of your own abilities rather than a comparison, so you're curious instead of scared.
- **When:** Use this when facing superior competition and you're psyching yourself out before it even starts, worried about the gap between you.
- **How:**
  1. Stop comparing, start exploring
  2. Say "Let's see what I've got"
  3. Go at them with your best stuff - see what works
- **Why:** When you shift from evaluation ("am I good enough?") to exploration ("what can I do here?"), the stakes disappear. You're not trying to prove you're better - you're discovering what you're capable of under pressure. That mindset shift removes fear and creates freedom to compete.
- **Vibe:** Experimental, fearless, "I'm curious"

### **Option C: "Nothing to Lose"**
- **Phrase:** "Play free, play fearless"
- **What:** This removes outcome pressure by accepting you're the underdog, which paradoxically frees you to play your best and sometimes shock people.
- **When:** Use this when you're matched up against someone everyone expects to dominate you, and you feel the pressure to not look bad.
- **How:**
  1. Accept that expectations are low (nobody expects you to win)
  2. Say "Play free, play fearless"
  3. Attack without hesitation - you have nothing to lose
- **Why:** When you're supposed to lose, there's no pressure. But often we create pressure anyway ("don't get embarrassed"). This code uses underdog status as freedom - nobody expects anything, so you can play with zero fear. That's when upsets happen. You're loose, they're tight. You're free, they're feeling pressure. That's your advantage.
- **Vibe:** Loose, dangerous, "upset alert"

## 6. Made a mistake / Can't stop replaying it

### **Option A: "Let It Go System"**
- **Phrase:** "Can't change it, moving on"
- **What:** This helps you stop the mental replay loop after mistakes by accepting what happened and redirecting your energy to what's next.
- **When:** Use this when you're stuck replaying a mistake - whether it was 5 seconds ago or 5 hours ago - and you can't seem to move past it.
- **How:**
  1. Say out loud "it happened" (acceptance)
  2. Say "Can't change it, moving on"
  3. Focus on the next opportunity to make it right
- **Why:** Your brain replays mistakes to try to "fix" them, but you can't change the past. The replay loop doesn't help - it just drains energy and confidence. Acceptance isn't giving up, it's choosing to invest your mental energy in the future instead of the past. This code interrupts rumination by acknowledging reality then consciously redirecting.
- **Vibe:** Mature, practical, "it is what it is"

### **Option B: "Learn & Release"**
- **Phrase:** "Noted, next"
- **What:** This helps you extract the lesson from a mistake without dwelling on it, so you actually get better while also protecting your confidence.
- **When:** Use this when you made a mistake that has something to teach you, but you don't want to get stuck in your head analyzing it forever.
- **How:**
  1. Identify ONE thing you learned from the mistake
  2. Say "Noted, next"
  3. Apply that one thing on your next opportunity
- **Why:** There's a difference between learning from mistakes and dwelling on them. Learning is quick extraction: what happened, what to do different. Dwelling is endless replay with no action. This code gets the value from the mistake (the lesson) while releasing the emotional weight. You keep the knowledge, lose the shame.
- **Vibe:** Smart, efficient, "got the lesson, moving on"

### **Option C: "Flush It"**
- **Phrase:** "That play's over"
- **What:** This uses a mental ritual to close the chapter on a bad play, preventing it from contaminating your next plays.
- **When:** Use this when a mistake happened and you need a clear mental break before your next play - like hitting a reset button.
- **How:**
  1. Take a breath and physically gesture (shake it off, brush your shoulders)
  2. Say "That play's over"
  3. See the next play as a completely new possession
- **Why:** Elite athletes use rituals to compartmentalize. The physical gesture + verbal phrase creates a psychological boundary between past and present. It's symbolic closure - you're literally "flushing" the mistake away. This prevents mental contamination where one bad play bleeds into the next three.
- **Vibe:** Clean slate, fresh start, "new play new me"

## 7. In your head overthinking / Not just playing

### **Option A: "Just Hoop Mode"**
- **Phrase:** "Stop thinking, start playing"
- **What:** This helps you shut off the analytical part of your brain and return to instinctive play when you're stuck overthinking.
- **When:** Use this when you're analyzing every move before you make it, second-guessing decisions, or feeling slow because your brain is working too hard.
- **How:**
  1. Notice you're thinking too much
  2. Say "Stop thinking, start playing"
  3. Make your next move on pure instinct - no analysis
- **Why:** Overthinking kills performance because your conscious brain is too slow. Your skills are stored in unconscious motor memory - they don't need supervision. When you shift from "thinking about playing" to "just playing," you access speed and flow that thinking blocks. This code is permission to trust your training and play free.
- **Vibe:** Simple, back to basics, "just play"

### **Option B: "Get Out of Your Head"**
- **Phrase:** "Trust what you know"
- **What:** This helps you reconnect with your automatic skills when overthinking is making you play like you forgot how to ball.
- **When:** Use this when you're so in your head that simple things feel hard, or when you're questioning skills you've had for years.
- **How:**
  1. Recognize you're overriding your training with thinking
  2. Say "Trust what you know"
  3. Let your body do what it knows how to do
- **Why:** You've practiced these moves thousands of times. They're automatic now - you don't need to consciously control them. But when anxiety kicks in, we start micromanaging every detail, which actually disrupts the automatic process. This code reminds you that your body knows what to do if you let it.
- **Vibe:** Trust, surrender, "my body knows"

### **Option C: "Flow State Protocol"**
- **Phrase:** "Feel it, don't think it"
- **What:** This shifts you from mental analysis to physical awareness, helping you access the effortless performance of flow state.
- **When:** Use this when you're stuck in your head planning and analyzing instead of feeling and reacting to the game naturally.
- **How:**
  1. Tune into one physical sensation (your feet on the ground, the ball in your hands)
  2. Say "Feel it, don't think it"
  3. Play based on feel and rhythm, not thought
- **Why:** Flow state happens when you're in your body, not your head. Athletes describe it as "playing by feel" or "being in the zone." When you shift attention from thoughts to sensations, you activate the embodied awareness that creates effortless performance. This is where your best basketball lives - in feeling, not thinking.
- **Vibe:** Flowing, present, "in the zone"

## 8. Everyone seems confident / You're faking it

### **Option A: "Real Confidence Blueprint"**
- **Phrase:** "Confidence is a choice"
- **What:** This helps you build authentic confidence from within instead of comparing yourself to others who seem like they have it all figured out.
- **When:** Use this when you're in the locker room or on the court and everyone else seems sure of themselves while you feel like an imposter.
- **How:**
  1. Stop watching others, focus on yourself
  2. Say "Confidence is a choice"
  3. Choose one thing you're good at and lean into it
- **Why:** Confidence isn't something you have or don't have - it's something you build through choices. When you compare your inside (your doubts) to others' outside (their appearance), you'll always lose. Real confidence comes from knowing your strengths and choosing to believe in them, regardless of how others look. It's internal, not relative.
- **Vibe:** Self-directed, authentic, "I decide"

### **Option B: "Build Your Own"**
- **Phrase:** "My game, my confidence"
- **What:** This helps you create confidence from your unique strengths instead of trying to copy others or wondering why you don't feel like them.
- **When:** Use this when you're feeling like you don't match everyone else's energy or style, and you're questioning if you belong.
- **How:**
  1. Identify what YOU do well (not what they do)
  2. Say "My game, my confidence"
  3. Play your style, not theirs
- **Why:** Comparing yourself to others kills confidence because you're not them. Your confidence has to come from YOUR game, YOUR strengths, YOUR style. When you stop trying to be like everyone else and own what makes you different, you build real confidence that can't be shaken by comparison.
- **Vibe:** Unique, authentic, "I'm different"

### **Option C: "Fake It Till You Make It"**
- **Phrase:** "Act confident, become confident"
- **What:** This uses confident behavior to create confident feelings, helping you break the cycle of waiting to feel confident before acting confident.
- **When:** Use this when you don't feel confident but know you need to show up confidently, and you're worried you're just faking it.
- **How:**
  1. Stand tall, make eye contact, move with purpose
  2. Say "Act confident, become confident"
  3. Keep acting confident even when you don't feel it yet
- **Why:** Confidence isn't a feeling you wait for - it's a behavior you practice. Research shows that acting confident actually creates confident feelings (not the other way around). Your brain takes cues from your body. When you stand tall, speak clearly, move decisively - your brain thinks "oh, we must be confident" and starts producing those feelings. It's not fake, it's training.
- **Vibe:** Practice makes permanent, "I'm becoming"
